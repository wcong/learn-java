/**
 * Given an array of words and a length L,
 * format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
 * <p/>
 * You should pack your words in a greedy approach;
 * that is, pack as many words as you can in each line.
 * Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
 * <p/>
 * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
 * If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words,
 * the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
 * <p/>
 * For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
